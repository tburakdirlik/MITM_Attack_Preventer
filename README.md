# MITM_Attack_Preventer
This tool make an alert for any man in the middle attack attempt and and protects you from hackers.

I am currently working on grapfical user interface of man in the middle attack preventer.
Ip addresses and arp tables can be showed and checking arp tables of the tool is working on the back side in main function.

Problems:

I can not show with button this function because while loop freeze the scene. 

Mac addresses and ip tables of the arp tables should be decompose to convenient data structure to be checked.
